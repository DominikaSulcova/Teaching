## Instructions for students
- Always update the processing scrip at the beginning of a work session.
- Do not run one section of the script more than once - if the script throws an  error and you are not able to finish the section, ask for help instead of trying to run it several times!
- Regularly backup your output MATLAB file to the shared OneDrive folder.
